BranchGLM News
================

# BranchGLM 1.1.0

-   Adding NEWS.md
-   Minimized repeated work for linear regression, so it should now be
    much faster
-   Additional arguments added to `BranchGLM()` to reduce memory usage
    if desired
-   Fixed print statement for BranchGLMVS when parallel computation was
    employed
